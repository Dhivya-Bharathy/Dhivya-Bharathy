# 👋 Hi, I'm DhivyaBharathy

### 🧠 AI Software Developer | Autonomous Agent Builder | LLM Orchestrator

I specialize in building intelligent, autonomous systems powered by OpenAI and the **Praison Framework**. My work integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with modern APIs, cloud tools, and scalable backends to create **real-world AI agents** that can think, plan, and act.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🤖 **Autonomous AI Agents**: I build agents that operate independently to complete complex goals.
- 🔗 **LLM Integration**: I combine GPT-4/3.5 with tools like **LangChain** to handle reasoning, memory, and tool use.
- ☁️ **Cloud & API Orchestration**: I connect agents to real-world data and systems using:
  - **Google APIs** (Calendar, Gmail, Docs)
  - **GitHub API** (PRs, issues, code review)
  - **Slack API** (chatbots, alerts)
  - **Supabase** (for memory and storage)

- 🛠️ **Tech I Use**:
  - **OpenAI, Praison Framework, LangChain**
  - **Node.js / TypeScript**
  - **Supabase, PostgreSQL**
  - **RESTful APIs & Webhooks**
  - **AWS, Vercel, Docker**

## 📌 Why AI Agents?

I believe the future of productivity lies in **autonomous AI agents** that can act on our behalf—whether managing our schedules, writing code, doing research, or making decisions. My focus is on **bridging LLMs with action**—enabling models to not just *think*, but *do*.
